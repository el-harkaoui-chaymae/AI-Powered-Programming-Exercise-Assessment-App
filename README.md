# AI-Powered-Programming-Exercise-Assessment-App

🔴 This project focuses on the development of an **AI-powered chatbot system** designed to automatically evaluate programming assignments submitted by students. The system mimics the role of a programming instructor analyzing student code, identifying errors, suggesting corrections, assigning a score, and providing an explanation to justify the score. 

🔴 The primary goals of this project are: 

**1 - Automatically Evaluate Code Correctness** 
Analyze submitted code to determine whether it correctly solves the given problem, 
identifying both syntactic and semantic issues. 

**2 - Detect and Explain Mistakes** 
Provide clear, concise explanations of any errors or suboptimal implementations found in the 
submitted code, helping users understand what went wrong and why. 

**3 - Suggest Improved or Corrected Solutions** 
Generate corrected versions of the submitted code or suggest better alternatives that align 
with best practices and solve the task as intended.
