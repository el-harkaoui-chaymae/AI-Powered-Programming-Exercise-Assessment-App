      "* The main issue with your code was that you were checking `if n % i == 0` instead of `if i % n == 0`. This means that the function would only return `False` if `n` was divisible by `i`, but not vice versa. For example, if `n = 12` and `i = 4`, then `n % i` is 0, which means that the function would incorrectly return `True`.\n",
      "* Another issue with your code was that you were missing a return statement for the case where `n` is prime. This is important because if no divisor is found between 2 and `n`, then the function should return `True` to indicate that `n` is indeed prime.\n",
